     *  the goal of this class will be to practice if else statements
     *  by creating a sample calculator which will add, multiply or subtract two values
     *  based on the user input of 'add' , 'multiply' and 'subtract'.
     *  
     *  *I am aware of and have implemented switch statements in the past however,
     *  I would like to get better at if else statments for the time being and focus on validating some inputs.
     *  
     *  Also for this class I would like to start implementing methods
